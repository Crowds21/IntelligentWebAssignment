## Commit Records
- [Commit Records](https://github.com/Crowds21/IntelligentWebAssignment/commits/main)

One of us switched his Github account, so some commit records may appear invisible. We saved the PDF for those commit records.
- [Part of commit records](https://github.com/Crowds21/IntelligentWebAssignment/blob/main/doc/Commits.pdf)

Sometimes, during our meetings, we engage in pair programming. As a result, there are instances where team members contribute to the implementation of a feature without corresponding commit records.

For example:
- Paradeepl contributed to the design and implementation of many chat functionalities.
- Leyan participated in various UI-related design and modifications.

Additionally, at times, due to configuration issues with Git on team members' local computers, other team members assist in submitting and merging changes on their behalf. These actions will be reflected in the commit descriptions on GitHub, such as "Leyan: UpdateUI", which means this work was completed by Leyan, but it was submitted by other member.
